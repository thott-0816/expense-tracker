# Next.js + Tailwind Development Instructions

Instructions for high-quality Next.js applications with Tailwind CSS styling and TypeScript.

## Project Context

- Latest Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Context7 MCP is available for library and framework documentation lookup

## Tooling Guidance

- Use Context7 when a task depends on external library or framework behavior, version-specific APIs, configuration details, or recommended patterns
- Prefer Context7 before guessing documentation details for Next.js, React, Prisma, Zod, Playwright, or other third-party tools used by this project
- Do not use Context7 for repository-specific logic that can be answered directly from the local codebase

## Development Standards

### Architecture
- App Router with server and client components
- Group routes by feature/domain
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use React Server Components by default
- Leverage static optimization where possible

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- Clear type definitions
- Proper error handling with type guards
- Zod for runtime type validation

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS with consistent color palette
- Responsive design patterns
- Dark mode support
- Follow container queries best practices
- Maintain semantic HTML structure

### State Management
- React Server Components for server state
- React hooks for client state
- Proper loading and error states
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

### Data Fetching
- Server Components for direct database queries
- React Suspense for loading states
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication checks
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting implementation
- Secure API route handling

### Performance
- Image optimization with next/image
- Font optimization with next/font
- Route prefetching
- Proper code splitting
- Bundle size optimization

## Implementation Process
1. Plan component hierarchy
2. Define types and interfaces
3. Implement server-side logic
4. Build client components
5. Add proper error handling
6. Implement responsive styling
7. Add loading states
8. Write tests
